Minek a rövidítése a JRE és mit jelent? Mi az a JVM?

JRE

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a set of software tools for development of Java applications. It combines the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), platform core classes and supporting libraries.

JRE is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK), but can be downloaded separately. JRE was originally developed by Sun Microsystems Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle Corporation. 

Also known as Java runtime.

JVM

A Java virtual machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode. There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance.
