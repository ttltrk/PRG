### 02.01.01 - Decision Making

---

```
Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 
The if statement is one of the most frequently used conditional statements.
If the if statement's condition expression evaluates to true, the block of code 
inside the if statement is executed. If the expression is found to be false, 
the first set of code after the end of the if statement (after the closing curly brace) is executed.
```

```java
if (condition) {
   //Executes when the condition is true
}
```

---

```java
Any of the following comparison operators may be used to form the condition:

< less than
> greater than
!= not equal to
== equal to
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to
```

```java
public class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(String []args){
         
        int x = 7;
        
        if(x < 42) 
          {
          System.out.println("Hi");
          }
     }
}

>>>
Hi
>>>
```

```
Remember that you need to use two equal signs (==) to test for equality, 
since a single equal sign is the assignment operator.
```
