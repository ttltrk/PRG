### 01.04.01 - Variables 1

---

```
Variables store data for processing.
A variable is given a name (or identifier), such as area, age, height, 
and the like. The name uniquely identifies each variable, assigning a value 
to the variable and retrieving the value stored.

Variables have types. Some examples:
- int: for integers (whole numbers) such as 123 and -456
- double: for floating-point or real numbers with optional decimal points and 
fractional parts in fixed or scientific notations, such as 3.1416, -55.66.
- String: for texts such as "Hello" or "Good Morning!". 
Text strings are enclosed within double quotes.

You can declare a variable of a type and assign it a value.
```

```java
String name = "David";

```
It is important to note that a variable is associated with a type, 
and is only capable of storing values of that particular type. 
For example, an int variable can store integer values, such as 123; 
but it cannot store real numbers, such as 12.34, or texts, such as "Hello".
```
