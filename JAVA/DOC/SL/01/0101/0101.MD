1.

Java is a high level, modern programming language designed in the early 1990s by Sun Microsystems, 
and currently owned by Oracle. 

Java is Platform Independent, which means that you only need to write the program once 
to be able to run it on a number of different platforms!

Java is portable, robust, and dynamic, with the ability to fit the needs of virtually 
any type of application.

Java guarantees that you'll be able to Write Once, Run Anywhere.

Java is used to develop apps for Google's Android OS, various Desktop Applications, 
such as media players, antivirus programs, Web Applications, 
Enterprise Applications (i.e. banking), and many more!
