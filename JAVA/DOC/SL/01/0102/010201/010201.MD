### 01.02.01 - Your First Java Program

---

```java
public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}

>>>
Hello World
>>>
```

* [J IDE](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php)

In Java, every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a class.
In our example, we named the class MyClass. You will learn more about classes 
in the upcoming modules.

In Java, each application has an entry point, or a starting point, 
which is a method called main. Along with main, the keywords public 
and static will also be explained later.

>As a summary:
>- Every program in Java must have a **class**.
>- Every Java program starts from the **main** method.
