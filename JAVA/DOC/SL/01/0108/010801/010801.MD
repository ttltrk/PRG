### Getting user Input

---

```
While Java provides many different methods for getting user input, 
the Scanner object is the most common, and perhaps the easiest to implement. 
Import the Scanner class to use the Scanner object
```

```java
import java.util.Scanner; 
```

```
In order to use the Scanner class, create an instance of the class
```

```java
Scanner myVar = new Scanner(System.in);
```

---

```java
You can now read in different kinds of input data that the user enters. 
Here are some methods that are available through the Scanner class:
Read a byte - nextByte()
Read a short - nextShort()
Read an int - nextInt()
Read a long - nextLong()
Read a float - nextFloat()
Read a double - nextDouble()
Read a boolean - nextBoolean()
Read a complete line - nextLine()
Read a word - next()
```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    Scanner myVar = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println(myVar.nextLine());        
  }
}

>>>

>>>
```

```
This will wait for the user to input something and print that input.
The code might seem complex, but you will understand it all in the upcoming lessons.
```
