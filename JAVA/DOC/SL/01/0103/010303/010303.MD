### 01.03.03 - Documentation Comments

---

```
Documentation comments are special comments that have the appearance of multi-line comments, 
with the difference being that they generate external documentation of your source code. 
These begin with a forward slash followed by two asterisks, and end with an asterisk 
followed by a forward slash. 
```

```java
public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    
    /** This is a documentation comment */

    /** This is also a
    documentation comment */
    int x = 20; 
    
    System.out.println(x);
  }
}
    
>>>
20
>>>
```

```
Javadoc is a tool which comes with JDK and it is used for generating Java code 
documentation in HTML format from Java source code which has required documentation 
in a predefined format.

When a documentation comment begins with more than two asterisks, 
Javadoc assumes that you want to create a "box" around the comment in the source code. 
It simply ignores the extra asterisks.
```

```java
/**********************

This is the start of a method

***********************/

>>>

>>>
```

* [J IDE](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php)

```
This will retain just the text "This is the start of a method" for the documentation.
```
