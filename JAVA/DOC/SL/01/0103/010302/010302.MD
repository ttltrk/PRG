### 01.03.02 - Multi-line Comments

---

```
Java also supports comments that span multiple lines.
You start this type of comment with a forward slash followed by an asterisk, 
and end it with an asterisk followed by a forward slash. 
```

```java
/*  This is also a
    comment spanning
    multiple lines */
    
>>>

>>>
```

---

```
Note that Java does not support nested multi-line comments. 
However, you can nest single-line comments within multi-line comments.
```

```java
/* This is a single-line comment:

    // a single-line comment

 */
 
>>>

>>>
```
