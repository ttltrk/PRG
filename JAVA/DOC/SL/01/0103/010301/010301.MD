### 01.03.01 - Comments

---

```java
The purpose of including comments in your code is to explain what the code is doing.
Java supports both single and multi-line comments. All characters that appear within 
a comment are ignored by the Java compiler.

A single-line comment starts with two forward slashes and continues until it reaches the end of the line. 
```
---

```java
public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
      
    // this is a single-line comment
    int x = 5; // a single-line comment after code  
    
    System.out.println(x);
  }
}

>>>
5
>>>
```

```java
Adding comments as you write code is a good practice, because they provide clarification 
and understanding when you need to refer back to it, as well as for others who might need to read it.
```
