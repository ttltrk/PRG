### 01.01.02 - The .NET Framework

---

```
The .NET Framework consists of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the 
.NET Framework class library.
The CLR is the foundation of the .NET Framework. It manages code at execution time, 
providing core services such as memory management, code accuracy, 
and many other aspects of your code.
The class library is a collection of classes, interfaces, and value types 
that enable you to accomplish a range of common programming tasks, 
such as data collection, file access, and working with text.

C# programs use the .NET Framework class library extensively to do common tasks 
and provide various functionalities.
These concepts might seem complex, but for now just remember that applications written in C# 
use the .NET Framework and its components.
