### 01.01.02 - Welcome to Python! 2

---

The three major versions of Python are 1.x, 2.x and 3.x. These are subdivided into minor versions, such as 2.7 and 3.3.
Code written for Python 3.x is guaranteed to work in all future versions. 
Both Python Version 2.x and 3.x are used currently. 
This course covers Python 3.x, but it isn't hard to change from one version to another.

Python has several different implementations, written in various languages. 
The version used in this course, CPython, is the most popular by far.
An interpreter is a program that runs scripts written in an interpreted language such as Python.
