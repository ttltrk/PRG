R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting. 
R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed 
by the R Development Core Team.

R is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for 
various operating systems like Linux, Windows and Mac.

This programming language was named R, based on the first letter of first name of the two R authors 
(Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka), and partly a play on the name of the Bell Labs Language S.
